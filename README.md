All repositories have been moved to Gitlab [https://gitlab.com/users/lucidlylogicole/projects](https://gitlab.com/users/lucidlylogicole/projects)

## why?
Thank you Github for your huge impact to open source projects by providing a great platform for storing code and collaborating! I have been considering moving to Gitlab for a while for the extra features and openess of the platform. The time has come to move.
Thanks again!
